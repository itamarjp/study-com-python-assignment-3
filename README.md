# Linear Regression on Housing Prices

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression analysis to predict house prices based on their size (in square feet) using Python, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

## Quick Start with Google Colab

You can easily run this project in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QiYRSHPRWuFp3DKliALm1ka6nW8j9Kx0?usp=sharing) without installing anything locally.  
Google Colab already includes all the required libraries, so you can simply open the notebook and run the code cells.

## Files

- **housing.csv**: Dataset containing house sizes and prices.
- **linear_regression.py**: Python script that loads the data, visualizes it, trains a linear regression model, evaluates it, and allows user input for predictions.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python libraries.

## Running Locally

### 1. Install Required Libraries

If you prefer to run the code on your own machine, install the dependencies using pip:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
